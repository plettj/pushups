# Josiah's Mental Health Awareness Pushup Counter Website

### What is this for?

I started the Wellness Warriors, a team of University of Waterloo students doing pushups to raise awarenes for men's mental health.

I pledged to do an extra pushup on top of the challenge for every 1 dollar donated.

This website displays the pushups and donations in real time!

### Where can I find it?
